It is a vertical pipe intended to distribute water to multiple levels of a building or structure as a component of the fire suppression systems. Most buildings have a wet riser or wet standpipe system where the pipes are kept full of water for manual or automatic fire fighting operations. Dry risers are used when the water pressure of a building wouldn't be enough for fire suppression, and in unheated buildings where the pipes could freeze. Dry risers have to allow access to a fire engine within 18 m of the dry riser inlet box. Dry risers in occupied buildings have to be within a fire-resistant shaft, usually one of a building's fire escape staircase enclosures."
